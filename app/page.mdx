My name is Hammad Majid and I&apos;m a Computer Science student from
Islamabad. I&apos;m currently doing full-stack web development as a
freelancer.

On this website you can find information about me, projects I have
worked on and posts I have written. I write mostly about stuff I find
interesting so there is no specific theme. These topics might include:
low level programming, web technologies, physics, mathematics and tea
recipes.
