My name is Hammad Majid and I'm a Computer Science student from Islamabad. I'm currently doing full-stack web development as a freelancer.

On this website you can find information about me, projects I have worked on and posts I have written. I write mostly about stuff I find interesting so there is no specific theme. These topics might include: low level programming, web technologies, physics, mathematics and tea recipes.
